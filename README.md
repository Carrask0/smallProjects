# smallProjects

This repository is meant to store small projects which are not worthy of having a repo of their own.
Currently these are the projects stored:

-STICKS (C)
-CALCULATOR (C)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'STICKS' is a game in which the player has 3 columns each with 4 squares. The last 2 columns are empty and the first one has 4 numbers (1-2-3-4). The goal is to   place those numbers in the last column by moving one number at a time and without placing a number obove a smaller one.

'CALUCLATOR ' is a program that enables the user to visually add, subtract and multiply two numbers the same way it would be done by hand, division is yet to finish.
